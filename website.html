	<p>We love video games. <br> <br> They're the best way to escape the monotony of our regular lives. They're fantastic stressbusters; that dopamine boost when we beat a level or a boss is <i> otherworldly </i>. They're a medium for art as well as storytelling. But that's not all there is to video games. 
	There's a whole global industry built around them - including their development, marketing, and monetization. You might say that side of games is not as interesting. I'd disagree with you. There's some fascinating stuff on the supposedly "soulless" number-crunching side, and I'd like to show you.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Let's take a look at the sales across different markets around the world:</p>
	<br>
	<div class="center"> <img src="charts/pie.png"> </div>
	<p>We see that <span style = "font-family: Nintendo;"> North America is the dominant market </span> for video games. </p>
	<p>Let's take a closer look at North America and its history with video games</p>
	<div class="center"> <img src="charts/NA_Sales.png"> </div>
	<p>2008 - the year with the most video game sales. <br>It was the year Mario Kart came out on the Wii. <br> It was also the year of the worst recession in history. Then why were there so many video games sold?</p>
	<p style="font-family: Arcade; color: #FF4554; text-decoration: underline;"> The Lipstick Effect <span class="extra"> The theory that when facing an economic crisis consumers will be more willing to buy less costly luxury goods. Like lipstick. Or video games. The idea is that small indulgences raise morale.</span> </p>

	<p> Let's take a look at how well different genres sold over time </p>
	<div class="center"> <img src="charts/GenrevTime_area.png"> </div>
	<p> <span style = "font-family: Nintendo;"> Americans seem to love action games </span> - they bought so many of them. The peak of that Area chart is most likely due to the various GTA games realeased over many years across multiple different platforms.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Speaking of platforms, let's look at the data to find the top-selling one:</p>
	<br>
	<div class="center"> <img src="charts/ConsolevSales_stack.png"> </div>
	<br>
	<p> <span style = "font-family: Nintendo;">PS<span style = "font-family: GB;">2, </span> XBox <span style = "font-family: GB;">360, </span> and PS<span style = "font-family: GB;">3 </span> are the top three selling consoles</span> <span style = "font-family: GB;">? </span> </p>
	<p>
	Well, that's not surprising at all. 
	PS2 and PS3 are in the top three, and they're both consoles made by Sony Computer Entertainment. So, is it safe to assume that Sony is the publisher with the most sales?</p>
	<br>
	<div class="center"> <img src="charts/PubvSales_stack.png"> </div>
	<br>
	<p> Apparently not. </p>
	<div class="center"> <img src="images/nintendo_logo.jpeg" style = "width: 1000px; height: 400px"> </div>
	
	<p> These guys are at the top, overshadowing their competitors by a <b> <i> HUGE </i> </b> margin. There were two interesting things to note in that chart:<br>
	 1. <span style = "font-family: Nintendo;"> Nintendo has the highest global and North American Sales </span> <br>
	As North American sales have the highest imapct on Global sales, this makes sense. They also dominated the American market in the late 90s and early 2000s with the Nintendo 64, whose hardware was leaps and bounds ahead of its competitors, providing a better gaming experience. <br>
    2.  <span style = "font-family: Nintendo;"> It has a much bigger Japanese market than its competitors. </span> <br> 
	This is probably because it's a Japanese company.</p>
	
	<p> Let's dig a little deeper into Nintendo to see if we can find some more interesting stuff. </p>
	<br>
	<div id="imagesMain">
		<img src="charts/Nint_NA_Sales.png"> 
		<img src="charts/Nint_JP_Sales.png">
	</div>
	<br>
	<p> Both these graphs have one thing in common - a huge peak for the year 2006. This was when the Wii console entered the market.</p>
	<p> So is the Wii the best-selling platform in both countries? </p>
	<div id="imagesMain">
		<img src="charts/Nint_NA_Sales_Plat.png">
		<img src="charts/Nint_JP_Sales_Plat.png">
	</div>


	<p> No it isn't! </p>

	<div id="imagesMain">
		<img src="images/wii.jpeg">
		<img src="images/DS.png">
	</div>

	<p> North Americans preferred the Wii, but the Japanese preferred the DS. Why? Let's find out.</p>

	<br>
	<div id="imagesMain">
		<img src="charts/DS_Wii_Year.png">
		<img src="charts/WiivDS.png"> 
	</div>
	

	<p> More DS games were released than Wii games. Japan sold MANY more DS games per year than Wii games. However, North America had higher sales for the Wii due to the initial surge of buyers on its release.</p>

	<p> Here we see different buying patterns in North America and Japan for the same products. This gives us an insight into the fact that gaming culture is different in different parts of the world. However, in spite of the fact that we have these differences with people around the world, we are united by our love of video games.</p>

	<p> Well, that was all I had. Thanks for sticking with me till the end, and I hope I showed you the interesting side of all the business and number crunching stuff that happens behind the scenes when our favourite games are released. </p>
